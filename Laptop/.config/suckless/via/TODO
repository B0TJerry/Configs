Allow for manually rebuilding the cache by simply calling via again while it is running. For example, if via is started with <Alt+Space>, pressing <Alt+Space> again while via-menu is shown will trigger a cache rebuild. One way to do this is to check, at startup, if another via-menu is running. If it is, kill it, rebuild the cache and then go on.
