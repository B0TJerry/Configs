Night after night
I try to make it all fit together
Night after night
I see you as someone I remember
You took me by surprise
Opened up my eyes
Now we gotta talk this over.

[CHORUS:]
Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

Day after day
I know it's not the way that you wanted it
Day after day
I try to find the key, but it don't fit
But you know how it is
No matter what I did
We gotta talk it over.

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Tonight, tonight
I'm thinking over everything you said to me
Tonight, tonight
I'm sorry, but I just didn't see
And now it's up to you
There's nothing else to do
We've gotta talk it over.

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Serious, so serious
Is it so serious?
Serious, so serious...
