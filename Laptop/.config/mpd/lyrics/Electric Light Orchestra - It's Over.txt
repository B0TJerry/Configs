Summer came and passed away,
Hardly seemed to last a day,
But it's over,
And what can I do.

Music playin' in the air,
Silence on a darkened stair,
Cos it's over,
And what can I do.

[Chorus]
It's over, It's over, all over,
It's over all over now,
And the way you looked
Don't even mean I'm down.
(It's over)
When you kick out the sea
And the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of.
(Getting down, down)
(It's all over)
(Getting down, down, down)
(Hurry baby, it's all over now, rose up to see)

Lookin' over sunny days,
(Searchin', searchin')
Searchin' for the righteous wave,
'Cos it's over,
All gone, what can I do
Lookin' from the distant shore,
(Distant shore)
You ain't sailin' by no more,
'Cos it's over,
(It's over)
And what can I do.

[Chorus]
It's over, It's over, all over,
It's over all over now,
And the way you looked
Don't even mean I'm down.
It's over, over
(It's over)
When you kick out the sea
And the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of.
(Getting down, down)
(It's all over)
(Getting down, down, down)

Ha, it's over, it's over, it's over
It's all over
(And what can I do)
Ha, it's over, it's over, it's over,
It's all over
(Oh, it's over, it's over, don't shed a tear for me
it's over, don't shed a tear it's over oh no, it's over)
