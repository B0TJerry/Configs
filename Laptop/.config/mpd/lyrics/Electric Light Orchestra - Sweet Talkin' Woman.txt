Where did you go?

I was searchin' searchin' on a one-way street,
I was hopin' hopin' for a chance to meet.
I was waitin' for the operator on the line.

She's gone so long what can I do?
Where could she be? no no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I gotta get back to you.

You gotta slow down slow down sweet talkin' woman slow down
You got me runnin' run run you got me searchin'.
Hold on hold on sweet talkin' lover hold on
It's so sad if that's the way it's over.

I was walkin' many days go by,
I was thinkin' thinkin' 'bout the lonely nights.
Communication breakdown all around.

She's gone so long what can I do?
Where could she be? no no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I gotta get back to you.

You gotta slow down slow down sweet talkin' woman slow down
You got me runnin' run run you got me searchin'.
Hold on hold on sweet talkin' lover hold on
It's so sad if that's the way it's over.

I've been livin' livin' on a dead-end street,
I've been askin' askin' (where's she hiding?) everybody I meet.
Insufficient data coming through.

She's gone so long what can I do?
Where could she be? no no no,
Don't know what I'm gonna do,
I gotta get back to you.
