You say the hill's too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you'd like to see me try
Climbing

You pick the place and I'll choose the time
And I'll climb the hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day

And as I rise above
The tree-line and the clouds
I look down
Hear the sound
Of the things you said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round
Frowning

And who's the fool who wears the crown
Go down in your own way
And everyday is the right day

And as you rise above
The fear-lines in his brow
You look down
Hear the sound
Of the faces in the crowd
