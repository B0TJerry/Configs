Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men

Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

"Forward!" he cried
From the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?

Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round

"Haven't you heard
It's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried.
"Listen, son,"
Said the man with the gun,
"There's room for you inside."

"Well, I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I could've given him a thrashin' but I only hit him once.
It's only the difference between right and wrong, innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they? Eh?"

Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about

With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died
